# For Fun

This repository is a playful sandbox where I experiment with code for entertainment and practice. It includes projects that manipulate the mouse pointer using Selenium and projects that draw lines on a canvas with trigonometric functions.

## Projects

### draw_lines_with_math
- `pointerTesting.mjs`: A script using math functions to draw lines on a canvas.
- `testPointer.html`: An HTML file to view the output of the line drawings.

### Selenium
A collection of utilities and scripts that interact with web browsers using the Selenium WebDriver.
- `notes.js`: Notes and snippets for Selenium operations.
- `package.json`: Node.js package information and dependencies for Selenium scripts.
- `test.mjs`: A sample script that moves the mouse pointer around on the screen using Selenium and ChromeDriver.

## Experimentation

These projects serve as a personal log of my coding adventures. They are not meant for any specific purpose other than to explore what's possible with code and to enjoy the process of creation.

Feel free to clone the repository and tinker with the scripts:

## Running the Selenium Scripts

To run the Selenium scripts, ensure you have Node.js installed, then install the necessary packages:
```
npm install
```

Make sure you have the ChromeDriver executable that matches the version of your Chrome browser.

To execute a script, use:
```
node test.mjs
```

## Viewing the Canvas Drawings
Open testPointer.html in your browser to see the trigonometric line drawing in action.
